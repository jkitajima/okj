This repository contains an experimental project written in Go. The primary purpose of this project is to explore and test various DevOps solutions and best practices for project structure.

The core focus of this experiment is to implement and evaluate observability features within a Go microservice. The project serves as a sandbox for thinking about and demonstrating how to effectively integrate monitoring, logging, and tracing into a microservice architecture.


### Ideas

Experimental Go Microservice: A simple service designed to be a testbed for new ideas.

DevOps Solutions: Investigation into tools and methodologies for continuous integration and deployment.

Project Structure Patterns: Demonstrates a clean and scalable directory structure for Go projects.

Observability-First Design: Built with a focus on metrics, logs, and traces from the ground up to ensure robust monitoring.
